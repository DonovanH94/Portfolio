	<h1>This is a Practice HTML</h1>
		<h2>A Very Basic Sheet with No CSS</h2>
			<p>So, to begin, this is very much a practice attempt to try and make a properly working HTML site. Of course, this will need to be a very simplified version with litttle to no CSS as I have yet to reach that portion of website coding.</p>

			<p>It actually took me a while to get the image above to work properly. <strong>The worst part about this is that I would need to use an image of the internet, but need to get the URL. If I were to try and get it on my computer, it would still need to exist in my laptop.</strong></p>

	<h1>Continuing with the Practice HTML</h1>
		<h2>Let me throw some random stuff in here</h2>
			<p>So I am going to just put in a bunch of elements that I can remember so I can practice.</p>
			<p>Here goes a list:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Here is my first list item</li>
					<li>This is the second</li>
					<li>Right here is the third</li>
					<li>Fourth is up next</li>
					<li>Fifth and Final</li>
				</ul>
			<p><a href="https://www.lifeoptimizer.org/2014/10/28/how-to-get-good-at-something/" target= "_blank">Actually</a>, I'm gonna try and have a random link pop up to a random site here. It's basically a way to get good.</p>
